<h3>Jab We Met</h3>

<p>I think this film is one of the best to come out of Hindi Cinema in the mid-2000s outside of a film starring Shahrukh Khan. 
    This film perfectly captures the magic of Hindi Cinema with its relatable story and characters. The chemistry between 
    leading pair Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor is amazing. They both play their characters to perfection. The song and dance
    numbers of the film are perfectly placed within the context of the narrative and do not interrupt the flow of the story. It's 
    simply a beautiful film from start to end. One that has stood the test of time for over 15 years.

<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>

<p>Honestly, if any series will stand the test of time, it is Harry Potter. This is a tale that will be told from one generation
    to the next and the films perfectly capture the magic and awe of the wizarding world. I personally feel that the films will 
    forever have a special place in the hearts of the audiences that grew up with the story and that is what will keep this tale
    going from one generation to the next. From the on-screen performances delivered by some legendary actors to the breathtaking
    and awe-inspiring visual set pieces and production, the Harry Potter films stand in the upper echelon of cinema's finest films.

<h3>Veer-Zaara</h3>

<p>If you're looking for a love story that pulls at the heartstrings, look no further than Yash Chopra's 2004 masterpiece in 
    Veer-Zaara. Starring Shahrukh Khan and Preity Zinta in the lead roles, this love story is one that transcends all others. 
    If you're ever wondering whether true love finds a way, this film shows that despite all odds and heartbreaking tragedies, 
    in the end, true love finds its way. One of the most heartfelt films I personally have ever seen.

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

<p>In my opinion, this is the film that changed the direction of comic book films and really set the bar for what super hero
    films that followed aspire to achieve. This film is a masterclass in every aspect. From its amazing performances by legendary actors 
    Christian Bale as the titular Bruce Wayne/Batman and Heath Ledger as The Joker delivering a performance that, to this day, 
    is still widely regarded as the best on-screen portrayal of the legendary Clown Prince of Crime to the phenomenal direction by
    critically-acclaimed director Christopher Nolan, who did a magnificent job in really grounding this film into reality, making it
    feel like Gotham is an actual city, this film set a standard for super hero films. I really think this is the film that pushed
    comic book films into the zeitgeist of mainstream cinema and what would eventually lead to the boom of CBM films in the 2010s.

<h3>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy</h3>

<p>Before Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy elevated the comic book film genre to the next level, it was Sam Raimi's 
    Spider-Man trilogy that had set the groundwork for future super hero films to build off of. I think that Raimi's Spider-Man films
    are amongst the best films in the comic book genre with 2004's Spider-Man 2 still being widely regarded as one of the best super hero 
    films of all time. I think Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy is filled with beautiful moments that really capture the emotional depth of each
    character. Tobey Maguire's portrayal of the titular hero Peter Parker/Spider-Man remains to this day many people's favorite on-screen portrayal
    of the web-head due to his relatability. You as the audience member could relate to his Peter Parker throughout the entire journey. He really 
    came off as a kid who is just trying his best every single day and not just the invincible super hero which makes us as an audience relate to his
    performance all the more. The same can be said for the brilliant performances of the villains in each film. I think Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy has 
    aged like a fine wine in that these films feel very grounded in reality.
